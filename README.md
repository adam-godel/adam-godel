# Adam Godel
I am a first-year student studying mathematics and computer science at Boston University. While I am interested in a multitude of CS topics, my recent research interest has been quantum computing. In my senior year of high school, I served as a quantum outreach ambassador for Qubit by Qubit after taking their Introduction to Quantum Computing online course. Since then, I have begun doing quantum computing research by working on a handful of research projects for different quantum computing companies.
